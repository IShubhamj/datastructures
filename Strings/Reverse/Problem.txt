Problem statement -

Write a function which will accept a string and return it's reverse version.

Eg:  Input - hello
     Output - olleh
    
    
    Input - abcdef 
    Output - fedcba

There are three solutions

Solution1 contains raw logic without leveraging any inbuilt functions

Solution2 uses ES6 methods like split, reduce to achieve expected Output

Solution3 is ES6 one line solution using split, reverse, join

in Solution 2 & 3 we are leveraging js inbuilt functions like split, reverse and join
